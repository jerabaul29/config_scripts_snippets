"""A small hello world for asyncio async await
The idea here is to show "how to think about async await". I like to have the following mental model:
- in Python, "usual" async await allows to get concurrency within a single thread; i.e., switch between different slow
tasks (when we know that something is slow and that we may do something else in the meantime), using only 1 CPU on the
physical machine. This is like having 1 bartender, serving several clients in the pub.
- i.e. this is very useful for using 1 OS thread / 1 machine physical CPU for doing several slow tasks
concurrently, i.e. switching between these tasks to make all of them advance as fast as possible together,
even though each task may have some forced waiting time now and then (you do not serve a new beer to a
client before the ongoing beer is drunk finished).
- i.e., in python, "usual" async await asyncio is a way to share a thread / machine CPU time between several
concurrent tasks.
- for this, one needs to:
-- "schedule" some tasks with asyncio.create_task or similar
-- give asyncio the chance to switch between tasks; this is done through the await keyword; when hitting
an await keyword, if the corresponding function call is not ready yet, the asyncio runner is free to look
for / jump to other async tasks and spend time on these
-- be CAREFUL not to use non-async (i.e. blocking) slow functions when trying to formulate some async code: these do not get
awaited and cannot give time for the runner to do anything else asyncronously.
