Scripts to grep (zg) and execute the output of the grepping (zx) the z data table.

To make available, simply source for example by adding to the bashrc:

```
source PATH_TO_THIS_FOLDER/zg.sh
source PATH_TO_THIS_FOLDER/zx.sh
```

One the very first use of `zg` you will get an error message - this is expected and fine.
