To install, simply source, for example from your ```.bashrc```:

```bash
# my hg and hx scripts
source "YOUR_PATH_TO_THIS_REPO/scripts/hist_grep_exec/histg.sh"
source "YOUR_PATH_TO_THIS_REPO/scripts/hist_grep_exec/histx.sh"
```

The first time `hg` is run you will get an error; this is fine and expected.
